%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Bike sharing systems have gained immense popularity in recent times. The usage of bikes has drastically increased in urban areas as a popular mode of commute due to the traffic congestion and in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint of the planet. Visualizing and analyzing the current operations can assist in getting a better grasp of the system. In this
paper, a data visualization approach is used to identify important factors related to bike-sharing systems. We analyze the data from this system such that we are able to group the bike renting trends season-wise, locate the busiest stations in a locality, analyze the revenue generated, costs incurred in maintaining the bikes, number of monthly or flex passes taken by the customers every quarter. We mine the Metro Bike Share, Los Angeles data and discuss the findings of this data set. We examine the bike-share system during different quarters of the year and during both peak and non-peak hours. Through this we maybe able to potentially analyze the sustainability of the bike sharing system.
