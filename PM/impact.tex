Though the idea of sharing bikes in the urban area was introduced in Amsterdam in 1965, it has recently gained adequate traction in the United States. 
Thus there is not a robust amount of scientific literature available on the various trends and factors in this field. 
Our aim is to provide understanding on how the numbers of customers vary from season to season, which areas are the most popular for this kind of venture, moreover how the revenue is varying over different quarters. 
This will give insights about the viability of this type of venture in the United States and may point to other sites where there might be potential for viable growth.
And future research may be continued in this field where a more expansive dataset will be used for further visualization.
