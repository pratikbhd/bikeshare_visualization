%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Bike sharing systems are gaining immense popularity as an alternative or complementary mode of urban transport. Bike sharing can provide an alternative to traditional modes of transport or, more likely a complementary service for solving the "last mile problem" of getting from a public transportation stop to the final destination. Furthermore, bike sharing systems may help mitigate automobile congestion and reduce pollution, although relatively little research has been done to asses their actual impact in these areas. Visualizing and analyzing the current operations can assist in getting a better grasp on the performance of the system. In this paper, a data visualization approach is used to identify important factors related to the bike-sharing system. We analyze the bike-sharing system such that we are able to group the bike renting trends, locate the busiest stations in the locality and number of monthly or flex passes taken by the customers for different time granularity. We mine the Metro Bike Share, Los Angeles data and discuss the findings of this data set. Using this publicly available data, we conduct some experiments combining data filters and visualization, potentially analyzing the sustainability of the bike sharing system.
For this milestone, we have expanded on our progress from the first milestone. One of the major tasks was to work on the refinements that were suggested from the first milestone. Besides that, we studied and analyzed more related work and reference materials. A better, more robust schedule for the project was developed and in addition to that, some new ideas for visualizations were put forward in this milestone. Since this project is an application based approach to data visualization, we tailored a similar evaluation process for our project.
